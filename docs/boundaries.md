# DMCS Boundary Guidance

Concise rules for common grey areas in the DMCS standard. Each entry lists what is **in scope** for the referenced node and what is **out of scope**, along with tie-break guidance borrowed from MSCI, LSEG, and other incumbent methodologies.

## Data Centers — Real Estate vs. Services
- **In (08.04.001 Data Centers):** Powered-shell, wholesale colo, and REIT-style ownership/lease models where cash flows are driven by property assets.
- **Out (09.03.003 Data Center Services):** Managed colocation, interconnection exchanges, cloud edge nodes, managed bare-metal, or IXPs where revenue is service-led.
- **Tie-break:** Start with revenue mix. If within ±3 percentage points, use operating/gross profit; if still unclear, rely on management emphasis.

## Ad-Funded Consumer Platforms vs. Enterprise Software
- **In (10.03 Advertising & Attention Platforms):** Search, social, short-form video, or any platform with ≥50–60% revenue from advertising/attention monetisation.
- **Out (09.01 Software & Platforms):** Contracted SaaS and enterprise software where recurring licence or usage fees dominate.
- **Tie-break:** Revenue first, then earnings contribution; market perception may break persistent ties.

## Mobility — Platforms vs. Carriage/Logistics
- **In (04.07 Mobility Platforms):** Two-sided marketplaces and app layers brokering rides, deliveries, or micromobility without heavy asset ownership.
- **Out (03.03 Transportation & Logistics):** Asset-heavy carriage (trucking, parcel networks, air cargo) where fleets and infrastructure drive economics.
- **Tie-break:** Allocate primary to the largest revenue stream. If a secondary line is ≥25–30%, assign it as a secondary classification.

## Facilities & Property Operations — Property vs. Industrial
- **In (08.03.003 Facilities & Property Operations):** Property-level operations, maintenance, janitorial, and security tied to real-estate portfolios.
- **Out (03.04.003 Industrial Plant Services):** Plant turnarounds, industrial O&M, EPC-adjacent work, and HSE services at industrial sites.
- **Tie-break:** Follow the asset base—portfolio-tied contracts stay in Real Estate, process/plant-focused work shifts to Industrials.

## Game Distribution vs. Creator Platforms
- **In (10.02.005.02 Interactive Platforms & Distribution):** PC/console digital stores, launcher ecosystems, and marketplace-led game distribution (e.g., Steam, Epic, PlayStation, Xbox Live).
- **Out (10.03.002 Creator & UGC Platforms):** Generic creator hubs, social video platforms, and user-generated content networks monetised primarily by ads or creator tools.
- **Tie-break:** If the platform’s core revenue is game sales/royalties, keep it in 10.02; if advertising or creator subscriptions dominate, assign Industry 10.03.

## Broadcasting & Networks vs. OTT Streaming
- **In (10.02.002 Broadcasting & Networks):** Linear broadcast networks, MVPD/cable & satellite operators, and network programmers with carriage revenue.
- **Out (10.02.001 Film, TV & Entertainment):** Direct-to-consumer OTT and streaming services where subscription or advertising is tied to owned content libraries.
- **Tie-break:** Anchor on distribution model. If linear carriage remains ≥50% of revenue, keep 10.02.002; otherwise shift to the appropriate streaming segment under 10.02.001.

## Betting & iGaming
- **In (10.02.006 Betting & iGaming):** Online sportsbooks, iGaming platforms, fantasy sports, and marketplace-led wagering.
- **Out (04.04.003 Casinos & Gaming Venues):** Venue-led casinos and hospitality-driven gaming footprints.
- **Tie-break:** Apply the 25–30% secondary rule when online and venue operations are both material.

## Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN)
- **In (13.01.007 DePIN Infrastructure):** Protocols that supply compute, storage, wireless, or mapping resources to a marketplace.
- **Out (13.03.005 DePIN Applications):** End-user applications built atop DePIN resources (e.g., consumer mapping, IoT data services).
- **Tie-break:** Classify by where the entity earns revenue—resource supply vs. downstream application.

## Methodology Updates
- **Primary determination order:** (1) External revenue share (target ≥50–60%), (2) Earnings contribution (gross or operating profit), (3) Asset base for balance-sheet-driven entities (banks, insurers, REITs), (4) Management discussion and market perception when financial signals are inconclusive.
- **Persistence rule:** Require two consecutive reporting periods before flipping a primary classification unless a transformative corporate action occurs.
- **Scope notes:** Maintain an "included / excluded" one-liner for every subsector with known boundary collisions (Data Centers, Advertising Platforms, Facilities, Mobility, Game Distribution, Broadcasting, Betting, DePIN).
