### Changed

- **Label Clarity Improvements (5) — Asset vs. Service Disambiguation:**
  
  *These label updates improve clarity between asset ownership models (REITs) and operational service businesses, addressing user feedback on classification boundary guidance.*
  
  **Improvement 1: Carbon Services Disambiguation**
  - `11.04.003` Carbon Project Services & Trading → **Carbon Project Development & Services**
  - *Rationale: Distinguishes project development (engineering, consultation) from financial exchange trading (07.03.006)*

  **Improvement 2: Data Center Business Model Clarity**
  - `08.04.001` Data Centers → **Data Center REITs & Assets**
  - `09.03.003` Data Center Services → **Data Center Colocation & Services**

  - *Rationale: Explicitly identifies REIT ownership model to distinguish from telecom service providers*

- **Label Updates (6) — Taxonomy Validation Error Resolution:**
  
  *These label changes address conflicts identified after implementing automated label similarity and redundancy validation. Prior to v1.2.2, our validation tooling did not check for duplicate or semantically overlapping labels across different hierarchy branches. This gap allowed conflicting labels to be introduced during taxonomy expansion.*
  
  **As of v1.2.2, we guarantee full ID immutability moving forward.**
  
  **Conflict Fix 1: Agency Services**
  - `10.04` Advertising & Marketing Services → **Advertising & Marketing Technology**
  - `10.04.002` Agencies & Brand Services → **Marketing Automation & Data Platforms**
  - *Rationale: Creates clean AdTech/MarTech separation from agency services in 14.03.003*

  **Conflict Fix 2: CRM Duplication**
  - `09.01.001.02` CRM / CX → **Supply Chain & Procurement Software**
  - *Rationale: Removes CRM conflict with 09.01.006; fills major software category gap*

  **Conflict Fix 3: PaaS Misclassification**
  - `09.01.002.01` Infrastructure PaaS → **Collaboration & Productivity**
  - `09.01.002.02` Data / AI Platforms → **General Business Management**
  - *Rationale: Corrects misclassified segments to actual Enterprise SaaS categories (Slack, Atlassian, project management)*

  **Conflict Fix 4: BI & Analytics Duplication**
  - `09.01.004.03` Analytics / BI → **Observability & Monitoring Platforms**
  - *Rationale: Removes BI conflict with 09.01.005.03; fits developer-focused PaaS (Datadog, Splunk)*

- **Field ordering**: enforced specification sequence (`label → id → level → segment_code → parent_id → hierarchy → classification`)
- **Hierarchy validation**: confirmed all 295 nodes have zero duplicates and correct parent-child relationships

## [1.0.4] - 2025-11-09

### Changed

- **Major terminology update**: Renamed "Taxonomy" → "Classification" across entire codebase
