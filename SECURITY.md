# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately so we can investigate and release a fix before details become public. Use **GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature on this repository (Security ▸ Report a vulnerability).

We aim to acknowledge new reports within **3 business days**. After triage we will provide status updates at least every **7 days** until resolution. When a fix is ready, we will coordinate disclosure with the reporter and publish the patch in the next supported release.

Please avoid opening public issues or discussions for security-related matters. If you need to share additional context, attach it to the private report.
